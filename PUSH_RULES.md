Make this game called Push, this is how you play: You have 26 cards from a deck of playing cards and the other person has the other 26 cards from the same deck. There are no Jokers. There are 3 piles of cards you can play in. You can look at your card you pick from the top of your pile and play it in any 3 of the piles in the middle. There are 4 special cards: Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. The rest are number cards.

If someone plays an Ace on a pile, than the player that puts the forth number card on that pile is said to have a "push". A "push" means the other player must take that pile. The goal is to get rid of all your cards to win. If at any point a special card is played the pile resets. and is played to the rules of that special card.

If someone  plays a king on a pile, it's the same as an Ace but with three cards not four. The Queen is the same, but two cards not three or four. Same with the Jack but It's one card not Three, four or two. If you play a Jack on a Jack the other person takes the pile. If you play a special card on anther special card you take it if it is not a Jack on a Jack.

Make a web page where I can play against you.
