You are an expert coder. Implement the following changes. Think hard. Ask questions if something is not clear.

1. Strategy fix: The AI will play a J on the largest pile. A J often results in the player who plays it taking that pile in the next round. The AI should opt for whichever pile would result in the smallest number of cards taken if the other opponent plays a number card next round.

2. Add a sound for "Watch Out!" like the soap opera sting "dun dun duuuuuun..."

3. When playing a rematch, a user's name changes to `true`.

4. On mobile, the 4 piles don't fit on the background and slightly exceed the screen. Squeeze them in.

5. Under the pile, it says (a) the number of cards, (b) "Your/Opponents" card: "2 to push". Omit the "Your/Opponent" card and colon. Just show "n cards" on one line and "n to push" below that, where 'n' is the indicated number of cards as currently shown.

6. Remove the "Hints and Tips" feature, including the toggle in settings.

7. When playing against another player (not the AI), it does not ding when the opponent plays a card. Add the ding sound that is played when the AI plays.
